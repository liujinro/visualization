# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
       Good Example:
       Reference: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/francisco8181/viz/WealthManagement_17210375097540/Overview

       Analyze:
     According to the knowledge I've gained from my visualization class, I will analyze the graph from various perspectives. Then, I will evaluate whether the graph effectively serves the customer's needs

     Customization:
     1. The graph has a clear legend which explains well for all the data points. The graph can help in distinguishing between different categories or data series effectively.
     2. From the visualization, I can easily understand the highlighted key data points and trends as the graph has detailed and clear annotations.
     3. The axis labels are descriptive and provide sufficient information about what each axis represents. For example, from the Overview, I can easily catch which production clients most prefer and which is not favored. I can also easily track the status of distribution and withdrawals timely, observing the trends closely. Similarly, I can easily find the client information from the client tab and can roughly detect the age level of the client for distribution. Nevertheless, there should be more detailed information on client details as I cannot easily track each client based on the visualization alone. This is one part that can be further developed to enhance the overall effectiveness.
     
    Reproducibility:
    1. The data source is clearly cited, providing full transparency on the origins of the information used in the visualization. This ensures that users are aware of the credibility and reliability of the data.
    2. The methodology employed for the visualization is robust and adequate. There are precise calculations that are effectively demonstrated by the graph on the tab dedicated to client details. Moreover, the visualization fully meets the requirement for complex transformations of the data, facilitating an accurate representation of the underlying statistics.
    3. The process to illustrate how the data is generated by Tableau is clearly outlined. In other words, the creation process is transparently documented, making it straightforward for others to replicate the same visualization when they require it. This detailed documentation promotes a high degree of reproducibility, allowing users to trust and verify the presented data through their efforts
    
    Purpose and Audience:
    1. The visualization has a clear purpose, which is to effectively depict the status of accounts, particularly focusing on distribution and disposable income. Additionally, it targets a specific audience, primarily composed of users who will utilize the data for analysis or investment decision-making purposes. This tailored approach ensures that the visual representation is directly relevant and valuable to those engaged in financial planning and strategy.
    
    Perception and Cognitive Load:
    1. The visualization employs cognitive principles such as the Gestalt principles to organize the visual elements effectively. For example, by grouping related data points together, it significantly enhances the viewer's ability to discern and understand overall trends. This strategic arrangement not only aids in quicker comprehension but also reduces cognitive load, making the information more accessible and easier to process for the audience.

    Bad Example:

    Reference: https://datavizproject.com/data-type/pictorial-fraction-chart/

     Analyze:
     According to the knowledge I've gained from my visualization class, I will analyze the graph from various perspectives. Then, I will evaluate whether the graph effectively serves the customer's need.
     
     Customization:
     1. There is no legend explaining what the 75% refers to. It's unclear what the percentage is measuring (e.g., population, survey result, performance metric).
     2. There are no additional annotations or context provided. Without context, the significance of the 75% is unclear.
     3. Axis Labels: This type of chart typically doesn't have axis labels, but the absence of any explanatory text or labels leaves viewers guessing about the data's context.
     
     Axis Labels and Styles:
     1. The chart is visually simple, which is good, but it lacks detailed information that could provide clarity.
     
     Reproducibility:
     1. There is no citation or reference to the data source, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the presented percentage.
     2. The methodology used to arrive at the 75% figure is not documented.
     
     Programmatic Work:
     1. Without documentation of the steps taken to create this visualization, it is not reproducible.
     
     Comments and Metadata:
     1. There are no comments or metadata explaining the choices made in the visualization.
     
     Unclear Purpose:
     1. The purpose of the chart is not clear. The audience cannot easily understand what the 75% represents or why it is important..
     2. This type of pictorial chart is often used for simple and quick visual impact, but without context, it fails to convey meaningful information.
     
     Perception and Cognitive Load:
     1. Gestalt Principles: The simplicity follows Gestalt principles, but the cognitive load increases due to the lack of context and explanation.
     2. Increased Cognitive Load: The viewer is left to infer too much without sufficient information, increasing cognitive load unnecessarily.
     
     Objectivity and Neutrality:
     1. Potential Bias: Without context, the chart could be misleading. For example, the red color could evoke a negative connotation without justification.
     
     Provenance Rhetoric:
     1. Lack of Trustworthiness: The absence of data sources and methodology reduces the trustworthiness of the visualization.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      To transform this pictorial percentage chart into a more effective and informative visualization, consider the following improvements:

     1. Customization: Add a Legend:
     - Include a legend or explanatory text that clarifies what the 75% represents. For example, if it represents a survey result, it should be stated explicitly.
     2. Provide Annotations:
     - Add annotations to highlight key points or to explain the significance of the 75% figure. For instance, "75% of respondents are satisfied with the service."
     3. Axis Labels: 
     While pictorial charts typically donâ€™t use axis labels, adding a title or subtitle can provide context. For example, "Percentage of Survey Respondents Satisfied with Our Service."
     4. Enhance Visual Clarity:
     - Ensure the colors and design elements are consistent and not misleading. Avoid using colors that might evoke unintended emotions unless necessary for the data context.
     5. Reproducibility:
     - Clearly cite the data source.
     - Detailed Methodology: Provide a brief explanation of how the data was collected and processed. This could be included in a footnote or accompanying text.
     6. Document Methodology:
     - If possible, include a brief overview of the steps taken to create the visualization, especially if created programmatically. This aids reproducibility.
     - Provide additional details about the data and visualization choices. For example, "This chart shows the percentage of respondents who rated their satisfaction as 4 or 5 out of 5."
     7. Clarify Purpose and Audience:
     - State the purpose of the chart clearly. For instance, "This chart illustrates the high satisfaction rate among our customers."
     - Ensure the visualization is appropriate for the intended audience. If the audience is general, keep explanations simple and straightforward.
     8. Reduce Cognitive Load:
     - Use visual grouping and proximity to make the chart easier to understand. Ensure the design is not overly simplistic but provides enough information for comprehension.
     - Provide any additional context needed to understand the data. This could include a short paragraph next to the chart explaining the results in more detail.
     9. Maintain Objectivity and Neutrality:
     - Use colors and design elements that maintain neutrality unless highlighting specific insights. Avoid colors that might imply a negative or positive bias without context.
     - Ensure the visualization accurately represents the data without exaggeration.
     10. Improve Provenance Rhetoric:
     - By including data sources and explanations, the visualization becomes more trustworthy and credible. This encourages viewers to trust the information presented.
     
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
